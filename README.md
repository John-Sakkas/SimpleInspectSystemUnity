# Examine System

An Simple Examine System like Resident Evil, with a simple inventory. Created with URP  
and FPS Controller.

Every item has a title, description and an icon. All items in Inventory have a Tooltip 
and can be inspect again.
Also some basic reaction when you have all the object, like change scene 
and open a secret door/panel.
## How its Work!

Inside the __Manager Object__ is the __Player_Interactions__ script that gets the keys
press and call the fuctions like inspect / pickUp / interact.

__ExamineSystem__ is a script that control the current examined item. 
One of the main functions in this script is the resize function that take any item 
and resize it to fit the ExaminePoint Collider. Also reset the position if you 
dont pick up the object.

rotation , the zoomIn/zoomOut and to change the cursor icon.
